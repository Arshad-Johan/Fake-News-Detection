# Fake News Detection System

This project implements a Fake News Detection system using a combination of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. It is designed to classify news articles into two categories: `REAL` and `FAKE`. The system leverages both traditional ML techniques (TF-IDF and ensemble models) and an LSTM-based neural network for classification.

## Dataset

The project uses two datasets:
- **`True.csv`**: Contains legitimate news articles.
- **`Fake.csv`**: Contains fake news articles.

Both datasets include a `text` field with the news content. During preprocessing:
- The `label` field is added with values `REAL` for true news and `FAKE` for fake news.
- Only the `text` and `label` columns are used.

## Dependencies

The following libraries and tools are required to run the code:

- **Python** (3.7 or later)
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **NLTK**
- **Gensim**
- **scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **Joblib**

To install the required dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<h3>Implemented Models</h3>
<h4>1. Ensemble Model</h4>
Combines three classifiers:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Uses soft voting for final predictions.
<h4>2. LSTM Model</h4>
A deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
Architecture:
Embedding Layer (128 dimensions)
Two LSTM Layers (128 and 64 units)
Dense Layer with Sigmoid Activation
The model is trained using padded sequences generated by the Tokenizer.
